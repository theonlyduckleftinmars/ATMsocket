• If the server or client crashes during normal interactions,
• If the client processes the deposit, withdrawal, or balance function instead of the server,
• If a user can withdraw more money than is in the account
• If the balance function does not work
• If the withdraw function does not work
• If the deposit function does not work
• If the program does not perform general error checking on the input
